What to wear? - WTWR

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

This project is the first of many that will use React. A blend of HTML, CSS, JS, including native and remote API calls. This particular API used in the project is OpenWeather API. This API returns quite a lot of information but this project only used the current temperature and weather condition based on what the user's location is.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
